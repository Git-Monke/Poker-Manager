## Poker Manager

This is a poker money management tool that I threw together in 3 hours on the car ride to my grandparent's house. My friends and I needed a way to play poker at school when we didn't have access to fake chips. This tool served us well. I used NextJS and the shadcn/ui component library. Watch the YouTube video linked above for a demonstration of the tool.
